## YouTube MP3 API
This gem was build on top of [YouTube-Mp3.org](http://youtube-mp3.org).

[There I've described an API](https://github.com/Kofel/yt_mp3/wiki/YouTube-MP3-API)

Please note that *yt_mp3* is not responsible for failed conversions. There are limitations ex. 15 convertions for 30 minutes.
